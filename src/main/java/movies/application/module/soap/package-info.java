/**
 * SOAP client/server contract-last interface definitions of module.
 * Define here the SOAP client/server interfaces that are going to be developed with a contract-last approach
 * (i.e.: you start with the code).
 * This interfaces will be annotated with {@code @WebService}
 * and their methods will be annotated with {@code @WebMethod}.
 * However, consider using the recommended contract-first development approach,
 * where this SOAP client/server interface definition are generated from the WSDL that defines the SOAP service.
